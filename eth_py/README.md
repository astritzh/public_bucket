These scripts use an account generated by `geth`:

(Note `create_account.py` is just an example script 

## To create account:

Use geth to create a new account;

`> geth account new`

Follow instructions and enter password

## To use this account within these scripts:

Create a file `key_info.json` to store the keystore info, as well the URL path to connect to an eth client:
```
{
  "client": "path://to.eth/client",
  "path": "/path/to/geth/keystore/file",
  "pw": "password_for_geth_account"
}
```

## To connect to ETH client:

Suggest using `infura.io` - create an account and seutp a new project; they will then give you an endpoint to connect to an eth client.


## Notes on example scripts:

### Example deploy contract:

Compile the contract with:

```
solc --bin path/to/contract.sol
```

This will output the raw hex of the compiled contract which should be put directly in the `data` field of the tx to deploy the contract.
That tx should leave the `to` and `value` fields empty.

### Example mint/transfer ERC20 tokens:

These give examples of interacting with ERC20 token contracts.
The `to` field of the transaction will be the ERC20 contract being interacted with and the `data` field contains info of which contract function to call, as well as the args to pass to it:

The first 4 bytes indicate which contract function; it is found by taking the first4 bytes from the Keccak-256 hash of the function signature, e.g. `keccak('tranfer(address, uint256')[0:4]`.
This is followed by the args (each having a lenght of 32 bytes - i.e. 64 characheter hex string)

### Example flush erc20 tokens:

Example of calling the `flushToken(address to)` method defined in the `contract/forwarder_with_erc20_flush.sol` contract.

This will flush any existing Faucet token (`0xFab46E002BbF0b4509813474841E0716E6730136`) from this forwarder contract.
