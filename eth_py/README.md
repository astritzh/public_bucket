These scripts use an account generated by `geth`:

(Note `create_account.py` is just an example script 

## To create account:

Use geth to create a new account;

`> geth account new`

Follow instructions and enter password

## To use this account within these scripts:

Create a file `key_info.json` to store the keystore info, as well the URL path to connect to an eth client:
```
{
  "client": "path://to.eth/client",
  "path": "/path/to/geth/keystore/file",
  "pw": "password_for_geth_account"
}
```

## To connect to ETH client:

Suggest using `infura.io` - create an account and seutp a new project; they will then give you an endpoint to connect to an eth client.
